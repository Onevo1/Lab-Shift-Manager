## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Data Storage
- Your data is stored **locally on your device**
- Each person has their own copy of the schedule
- Data is **not automatically shared** between team members

### For Shared Schedules
Since data isn't automatically synced:

**Option 1: Single Manager**
- One person maintains the master schedule
- They export and share updates weekly/monthly

**Option 2: Individual Use**
- Each person manages their own shifts
- Use for personal schedule tracking

**Option 3: Manual Sync**
- Team members export their schedules
- Admin imports and merges them
- Redistributes the combined schedule

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I lost my schedule!"
- Import your last exported backup file
- If no backup exists, the data cannot be recovered

### "The link doesn't work"
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled (ask repository owner)
- Wait 5-10 minutes after initial setup
- Try clearing browser cache

### "My shifts disappeared"
- Don't use incognito/private mode (data won't persist)
- Don't clear browser data/cookies
- Make regular backups using Export

### "Changes aren't saving"
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure you're not in private browsing mode
- Try a different browser

## 💾 Best Practices

1. **Export Weekly**: Create backups every Friday
2. **Name Exports**: Use descriptive names like `lab-shifts-2026-01-27.json`
3. **Store Safely**: Keep backups in cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
4. **Bookmark It**: Save the application link for quick access
5. **Mobile App**: Add to home screen for app-like experience

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- No data is sent to any server
- Everything stays on your device
- No login or account required
- No tracking or analytics
- Completely private and secure
